    <h1>JavaScript and jQuery Flashcards!</h1>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>JavaScript (JS)</h3>
      <p>an object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Operators</h3>
      <p>An operator performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Variable</h3>
      <p>The <var> tag is used to defines a variable in programming or in a mathematical expression. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Variable naming conventions</h3>
      <p>In computer programming, a naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Functions</h3>
      <p>A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Methods</h3>
      <p>JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Arguments</h3>
      <p>Function arguments are the real values passed to (and received by) the function.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Parameters</h3>
      <p>Function parameters are the names listed in the function definition.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Return</h3>
      <p>The return statement stops the execution of a function and returns a value from that function.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Chaining methods</h3>
      <p>Chaining Methods, also known as Cascading, means repeatedly calling one method after another on an object, in one continuous line of code.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Strings</h3>
      <p>The String object is used to represent and manipulate a sequence of characters. Strings are useful for holding data that can be represented in text form.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Booleans</h3>
      <p>a binary variable, having two possible values called “true” and “false.”.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Undefined</h3>
      <p>The undefined property indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value, or not declared at all.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>NaN</h3>
      <p>NaN, standing for Not a Number, is a member of a numeric data type that can be interpreted as a value that is undefined or unrepresentable, especially in floating-point arithmetic.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Null</h3>
      <p>The value null represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is one of JavaScript's primitive values and is treated as falsy for boolean operations.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Alert</h3>

    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>jQuery</h3>
      <p>jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library. The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Attributes</h3>
      <p>a collection of objects that belong to a built-in Attr class, with name and value properties.</p>
